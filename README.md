# Lyle (Unofficial) Xtensa ISA Assembler

An (unofficial) assembler for processors compatible with the Xtensa instruction
set architecture. This is the instruction set used by ESP32 and ESP8266 chips,
among others.

### Example

**TODO**

### Dedication

The assembler is named Lyle rememberance of the author's maternal grandfather,
Lyle Evan Yates. He was born August 6th, 1934 and passed at age 87 on July
22nd, 2022.

Thanks for the memories, thanks for introducing me to computers, and thanks for
the Commodore 64. (And the slide rule, the book on BASIC, the Commodore 128,
and so much more!)

### Other notes

The idea for this assembler was also inspired for the 2022 Lang Jam ([#0003](https://github.com/langjam/langjam))
with the theme "Beautiful Assembly." It wasn't started or finished in time to
participate.
